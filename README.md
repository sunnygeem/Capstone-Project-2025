# Capstone-Project-2025
## Objective
As mentioned in the final paragraph of sqaureslab's github (https://github.com/squareslab/llmao), LLMAO has limitations in file-level application due to the 128-line input constraint of window context in LLM. Therefore, we conduct research to propose and implement solutions that improve this limitation, aiming to enhance LLMAO for file-level utilization.
## Introduced Solutions
  1. Sliding Window
  2. Static features extracted from AST
